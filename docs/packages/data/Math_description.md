The Math library contains functions for performing mathematical operations on number types, such as exact arithmetic.

Notice that there is no function for exact unsigned integer division, as division by zero is handled automatically by the compiler.

Inspiration for adding this library was taken from the SafeMath library in zeppelin-solidity: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/353285e5d96477b4abb86f7cde9187e84ed251ac/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol
